DESIGN DESCRIPTION

<Insert a description of your solution in English.  Describe any design
decisions that you made.  Do not submit pseudo-code.> 

TESTING STRATEGY

<Insert a detailed description of your testing strategy: at a minimum
you should explain how you tested your code, how you selected your inputs,
what those inputs were, and why you believe those inputs were sufficient
to test your code.>

For our testing strategy we extended the testing driver system given to us
and used the diff command to compare the output given by our program with
the reference program. For simple tests, we just visually compared the 
outputs of the two programs.

Our first test tried running programs that did not exist or were not
executable. Our second test runs the test programs myint and mystop.
We also tested synchronization bugs with the childhandler by adding
in sleep calls in the shell to force certain synchronization
cirumstances that might cause error. For example, we tested when
programs ended before they were added to the job list.
Then, we wrote a test that tested all permutations of
using '.', '/', directories in the cwd, executables in the cwd, and
executables in directories of the cwd. Then we wrote a test that
tested other programs in the path.

Combined, the tests test all conditions to find a program, all
conditions for which a program can halt (each signal type), as well
as race conditions between the shell and its running programs.
